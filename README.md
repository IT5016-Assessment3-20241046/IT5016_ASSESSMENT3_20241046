##  Repository Overview
This repository demonstrates research and practice in software development.  
It includes:
- My own original code (`turtle_drawing.py`)
- Practice/inspired code (`fibonacci.py`)
- Analysis of software design principles and patterns
- Commentary on programming concepts

##  1. Exploration of Design Patterns
### Own Code (turtle_drawing.py)
- Demonstrates **modularity** using separate functions for each shape (`draw_square`, `draw_triangle`, `draw_star`)  
- Shows **reusability** — functions can be called with different sizes, colors, and positions  
- Illustrates **design possibilities** — different shapes, colors, and positions allow creative programming options  
- Follows **KISS principle** — code is simple and easy to understand  

### Practice Code (fibonacci.py)
- Demonstrates **modularity** with functions like `get_guess` and `play_game`  
- Shows **error handling** — invalid user input is handled gracefully  
- Illustrates **loops and conditionals** for game logic  
- Offers **extensibility** — game can be modified for difficulty, scoring, or range

##  2. Analysis of Design Principles
### Key Principles Used
- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself):** Functions avoid repeating code  
- **Modularity:** Each task is inside its own function  
- **Error Handling:** Input validation prevents crashes  
- **Scalability and Extensibility:** Easy to add more shapes or game features  
- **Readability:** Comments and descriptive function names improve maintainability  

### Code Comments
- `turtle_drawing.py` comments explain shapes and functions  
- `fibonacci.py` comments explain input validation and game logic

# 3. Integration of Research and Practice
- **Own Practice:** Created turtle graphics to explore modularity, creative coding, and reusable functions  
- **Research Influence:** Inspired by online tutorials to create the number guessing game  
- **Learning Outcome:** Comparing creative own code and practice code shows how different approaches affect readability, maintainability, usability, and error handling

## Conclusion
This research repository demonstrates understanding of software design principles and programming practices.  
It connects theoretical concepts to practical coding examples using both creative (Turtle drawing) and guided (guessing game) projects.
