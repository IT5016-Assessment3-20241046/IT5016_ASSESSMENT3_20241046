# IT5016D – Assessment 3: Research Repository  
**Student Name:** *Jyoti Singh*  
**Student ID:** *20241046*  

## Repository Overview  
This repository demonstrates my research and practice in programming principles.  

It includes:  
- **My own original code** (`membership.py`) – a **Whitecliffe Student Club membership system**  
- **Practice/inspired code** (`fibonacci.py`) – **recursive and iterative approaches**  
- **Exploration of design principles and patterns**  
- **Reflections linking research and practice**

##  1. Exploration of Design Patterns  

### Own Code (`membership.py`)  
- **Object-Oriented Design** → Implemented with a class to encapsulate attributes and behavior.  
- **KISS Principle** → Code kept simple and readable.  
- **Separation of Concerns** → Input handling and logic are structured into separate methods.  
- **Open/Closed Principle** → Easy to add new programmes without rewriting major logic.  
- **Refactoring** → Used clean *if-elif* structure in menus.  
- **DRY Principle** → Avoided repeated code for member operations.  

### Practice Code (`fibonacci.py`)  
- **Recursion Pattern** → Elegant but less efficient for large inputs.  
- **Iteration Pattern** → More scalable and practical.  
- **Comparison of Approaches** → Highlights performance vs readability trade-offs.

## 2. Analysis of Design Principles  

### Key Principles in *Membership System*  
- **Encapsulation** → Member data stored inside a class object.  
- **Defensive Coding** → Input validation (checking Whitecliffe ID starts with "W").  
- **Composition over Inheritance** → Used lists instead of forcing subclassing.  
- **Clean Code** → Straightforward, avoids unnecessary complexity.  
- **YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It)** → Avoided adding features not required.  

###  Key Principles in *Fibonacci*  
- **Modularity** → Recursive and iterative functions are clearly separated.  
- **Scalability** → Iterative version handles larger *n* efficiently.  
- **Readability** → Recursive version shows the concept neatly for small values.

## 3. Integration of Research and Practice  
- **My Practice** → Developed a membership system applying OOP and design principles.  
- **Inspired Research** → Explored Fibonacci recursion vs iteration to compare algorithm efficiency.  
- **Learning Outcome** → Understood how software design decisions (recursion vs iteration, class-based design vs procedural) impact maintainability, performance, and usability.

## Conclusion  
This repository demonstrates my ability to:  
Build original code with strong design principles.  
Research and apply coding patterns from external sources.  
Reflect on how principles like **KISS, DRY, and OOP concepts** contribute to clean, maintainable software.
