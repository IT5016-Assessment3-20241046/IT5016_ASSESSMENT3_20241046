IT5016D – Assessment 3: Research Repository
Student Name:Jyoti Singh  
Student ID:20241046  

This repository demonstrates research and practice in software development.  
It includes:
- My own original code (turtle_drawing.py)
- Practice/inspired code (fibonacci.py)
- Analysis of software design principles and patterns
- Commentary on programming concepts

# 1. Exploration of Design Patterns

## Own Code (turtle_drawing.py)
- Demonstrates **modularity** using separate functions for each shape (draw_square, draw_triangle,draw_star).
  
- Shows **reusability** functions can be called with different sizes, colors, and positions.  
- Illustrates **design possibilities** — different shapes, colors, and positions allow creative coding options.
  
- Follows **KISS principle** (Keep It Simple, Stupid) — code is clear and easy to follow.  

# Practice Code (fibonacci.py)
- Demonstrates **modularity** with separate functions (get_guess and play_game).  
- Shows **error handling** — invalid user input is handled gracefully.  
- Illustrates **loops and conditionals** for interactive game logic.  
- Offers **extensibility** — game can be modified to change range, difficulty, or scoring system.

# 2. Analysis of Design Principles

### Key Principles Used
- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself):** Functions prevent repeated logic.  
- **Modularity:** Each task or shape/game logic is inside its own function.  
- **Error Handling:** Input validation prevents crashes.  
- **Scalability and Extensibility:** Easy to add more shapes in turtle or more features in the guessing game.  
- **Readability:** Comments and descriptive function names improve maintainability.  

# Code Comments
Both files contain inline comments showing how design principles are applied.  
- turtle_drawing.py comments explain shapes and function usage.  
- fibonacci.py comments explain input validation and game logic.

## 3. Integration of Research and Practice
- **Own Practice:** Created turtle graphics to explore modularity, creative coding, and reusable functions.  
- **Research Influence:** Inspired by online tutorials to make an interactive guessing game, learning design possibilities and defensive programming.  
- **Learning Outcome:** Comparing creative own code and practice code shows how different approaches affect readability, maintainability, usability, and error handling.

## Conclusion
This research repository demonstrates understanding of software design principles and programming practices.  
It connects theoretical concepts to practical coding examples using both creative (Turtle drawing) and guided (guessing game) projects.
